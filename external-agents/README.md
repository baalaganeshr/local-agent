# External Agents Integration

This directory contains external AI agent frameworks that we're researching and integrating with our Multi-AI Agents system.

## Current External Integrations

### ✅ OWL Framework (Completed)
- **Location**: `../owl/`
- **Status**: Fully integrated with CAMEL-AI backend
- **Integration**: Seamless through `owl_integration.py`
- **Usage**: Enhanced BaseAgent with `owl_process_task()` and `owl_collaborate()`

## Future Integration Candidates

### 🔍 Research Queue
1. **AutoGPT Framework** - Autonomous task execution
2. **LangChain Agents** - Tool-using agents
3. **CrewAI** - Multi-agent collaboration
4. **MetaGPT** - Software development agents
5. **AgentGPT** - Goal-oriented autonomous agents

## Integration Standards

All external agents must meet these criteria before integration:
- ✅ **Quality**: Minimum 80% test success rate
- ✅ **Compatibility**: Works with our BaseAgent architecture
- ✅ **Documentation**: Clear API and usage documentation
- ✅ **Licensing**: Compatible with our commercial usage
- ✅ **Maintenance**: Active development and community

## Integration Process

1. **Research Phase**: Evaluate agent capabilities and architecture
2. **Proof of Concept**: Create basic integration adapter
3. **Testing Phase**: Run comprehensive compatibility tests
4. **Adapter Development**: Build production-ready adapter
5. **Documentation**: Update integration guides
6. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to main system
